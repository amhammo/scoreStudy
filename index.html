            <p>Have you ever cooked a nice meal for your partner, only to bristle like a tetchy cat when they don’t offer to wash the dishes? If your first thought is, “BUT THEY OWE ME!”—you might end up feeling less connected with your partner.</p>

            <p>New research from Columbia University found that this kind of tit-for-tat monitoring, of who does what in a relationship, could lead to lower levels of intimacy following everyday tiffs. </p>

            <p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407519826743">study</a>, published online in February in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, offers a new way to examine how perceptions of everyday conflict
              affect intimacy between partners. </p>

            <p>The study followed 82 heterosexual couples over the course of a month using daily diaries. Each participant and their partner completed an initial questionnaire to assess their levels of “exchange orientation,” or their tendency to
              keep score in a relationship. To track daily intimacy, participants used a one-to-seven scale to measure three metrics: physical intimacy, emotional closeness and connection. </p>

            <p>For participants with lower levels of scorekeeping behavior, there was no noticeable difference in levels of intimacy following spats. But for those more likely to keep score, there was a measurable decrease in perceived intimacy
              after conflict. </p>

            <p>“For these people who are more likely to be doing these mental checks of who is winning or losing—are acting in ways to maintain balance—when a conflict with their partner does occur, their feelings of intimacy with their partner also
              takes a hit,” explains lead study author Shoshana Jarvis, who is now a Ph.D. student in social psychology at U.C. Berkeley. </p>

            <p>The implication is that people high in monitoring traits extrapolate everyday conflict to be a reflection of the whole relationship, explains Dr. Margaret Clark, a sociologist at Yale. The scorekeepers “react to conflict by becoming
              more self-protective and withdrawing intimacy,” says Clark, who was not involved in the study. But people low in monitoring “don’t make as big a deal out of the conflict. They’re not as stressed by it,” she says. </p>

            <p>Jarvis emphasized that the findings are only correlational, and that further observational studies in a laboratory are needed to draw conclusions. But she says it’s still useful to be mindful of monitoring tendencies. </p>

            <p>“No relationship is perfect, and there will be conflicts,” she says. “To the extent that someone can go into a conflict and have the tools to be able to navigate it with their partner well, it can make their relationships stronger and
              more resilient in future conflicts.”</p>
